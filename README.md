# Novulum project challenge

In this project I was given a mockup and a ticket with a set of defined tasks to complete. I built the project closely to the mockup but with a few design changes that I incorporated to try and be more appealing. To accomplish this task I utilized create-react-app along with pure CSS without any packages to help with styling.

# Application speed

* Currently this project scores a 96 on both mobile and desktop according to PageSpeed Insights

# Challenges

* Styling and trying to incorporate smooth animations proved to be much more difficult than I had thought. 
* I ran into a blocker to decide how to show a products details to take up half of the page rather than pushing all other products down below when its details container opened. 
* Creating app responsiveness for mobile and tablet. 


# Planning

Given the task of only representing a page that shows a list of products and being able to view their details, I only added one component in the ./src/components. I split the prodcut details into two so that I could accomplish the task of rending each product, and when a product is clicked on, it will render its details to the right without affect the layout of other products. 

I chose to utilize Flexbox rather than Grid given that there did not seem to be many differing parts of each product. I felt that utilizing Flexbox would take less development time for this task. 

# Resources utilized

I mostly relied on google and stack overflow to find the answers I needed as well as css-tricks. 

# What I Learned

I feel that I definitely learned more about containers and how to utilize Flexbox and height to be more responsive. I have not had much practice with @keyframes, animations, and media-queries. Learning the basics of these and being able to incorporate them was very benficial, considering how much of a difference having a smooth application makes.
